The GRASS dev team has just released a new GRASS 8.4.1 stable release. It contains over 80 new featues and bug fixes. You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases/tag/8.4.1). I've posted them on the downloads page.

Thanks for Nicklas Larsson for creating officially signed Mac binaries.

Enjoy!
