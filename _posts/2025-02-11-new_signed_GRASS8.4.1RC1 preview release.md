The GRASS dev team has just released a new GRASS 8.4.1 release candidate 1 for you to try out. It contains over 70 new featues and bug fixes. You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases/tag/8.4.1RC1).

Thanks for Nicklas Larsson for creating officially signed Mac binaries. I've posted them on the downloads page.

Enjoy!
